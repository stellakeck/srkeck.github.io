<h3>Op-Ed Assignment</h3>
<p><b>Target Journal: Boston Globe</b> <br> <b>21 Nov. 2017</b> <br> <b>Why I don’t enjoy these warm November days:</b> <br><br> Climate change is real and upon us. As a world, we’ve begun to see the serious side effects of unregulated carbon emissions. Climate change causes the Earth’s ice caps to melt, breeds dangerous super storms, and widens geographic ranges of vector-borne diseases. With each warm day in October and November this year, I hear people exclaim about the wonderful weather and their excitement of having one more beach day before winter. However, due to climate change, the beaches we have today will be drastically different in forty years due to rising sea levels. That is what I think about when I step outside in November wearing a t-shirt and jeans.</p>
<p>It seems like every year is the hottest year yet, each calendar year competing with the last hoping to finally prove a point to politicians and the general public: climate change is real. Our warming climate has increased glacial and ice sheet melting and the warmer ocean surface water facilitates thermal expansion, both increasing sea levels. The current rate of sea level rise is more than 1/8 inch per year and is increasing. By the end of the century, sea levels may rise by up to 4 feet. My father has joked that in one hundred years my childhood home in Maine may be located on highly coveted coastal property, an exaggeration but a reality of millions of people around the world. Projections drafted by geologists, climate scientists, and researchers at NASA, show Manhattan and Miami underwater by 2100. Here in Boston, Fenway Park, MIT’s campus, and Mass General Hospital will be submerged. Several cities, including Boston, have begun to prepare, creating “comprehensive climate resilience plans,” which includes reinforcing beaches, building bulkheads, and protecting natural barriers.</p>
<p>Sea levels will hit close to home but across the world future impacts are far greater for megacities like Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Shanghai, China. Tens of millions of people will be forced to migrate inward. For cities and countries unable to build upwards, this relocation inward means massive efforts to rebuild and maintain acceptable living standards. Urbanization, overpopulation, and an increasing fear of immigration creates conditions which breed disease and violence among groups. Human rights crises, like the influx of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh, are becoming more common in countries hit hardest by climate change and increased flooding.</p>
<p>Clean water and adequate sewage systems are required to prevent diseases such as cholera from ravishing young children and the elderly. The relocation of millions of people in a fairly short span of time causes decreased sanitation, increased waste, and contaminated water sources. The health and livelihood of low income countries will be hit hardest by rising sea levels due to a disparity in protection and preparedness. Without access to resources to prepare against rising sea levels or to rebuild infrastructure after migration, epidemics of disease will occur. In addition to increased disease, rising sea levels threaten food security and access to viable drinking water. Rice quantity in Vietnam is expected to decrease by at least 15% due to soil contamination from increased salinity. Bangladesh has been identified as being at risk for water shortages by 2050. A lack of infrastructure to prevent massive flooding and rising sea levels demonstrates environmental racism and injustice. High income countries, such as the United States, disproportionately burden low income countries with the adverse effects of excessive carbon emissions. We are the second largest producer of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the world, and yet we don’t see the deadly effects of our actions because we have the resources to adapt to rising sea levels.</p>
<p>What do we do? The Paris Climate Agreement, signed April 22, 2016, aims to keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius from the pre-industrial levels. With Syria joining the Agreement November 7th, the U.S. is the only country in the world not working towards a better future. We are at a tipping point. The individual freedom to choose fossil fuels over alternative sources risks destruction of the natural environment and increases morbidity for millions of people. It is our responsibility to prevent further environmental destruction at home and abroad by changing our actions. We need laws regulating GHGs at both ends of product creation and consumption. We need to change American culture and normalize alternative fuels to become a pioneer in the fight against climate change. While the White House may not be listening, other leaders are. We need to rally behind our governors who created the bipartisan Climate Alliance, a coalition of states committed to reducing GHGs and fulfilling the goals of the Paris Agreement, and push for more states to join. We can be joining world leaders in the fight against climate change to preserve our beaches and the world’s health.</p>

<h3>Climate and Health Case Study: Agriculture in California</h3>
<p>(personal section of a group paper)</p>
<p>It is crucial to consider how American agriculture and food systems have impacted and will continue to impact climate change through greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and food transportation. Anthropogenic GHG emissions have caused clear changes in temperature and precipitation trends due to climate change. This section will address how California’s GHG emissions have changed over the years, but because one entity alone is not responsible for global climate change, the global agricultural sector’s influence on climate change will also be discussed. In general, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that agriculture accounts for 30% of anthropogenic GHG emissions, which includes crop and livestock production, forestry and associated land use changes. Global GHG emissions from the agricultural sector has on average increased by 1.6% per year from 1961 to 2010 (Tubiello et al., 2013).Over this same time period, crop, milk, and meat production has increased on average 2.2%-6.4% per year. Looking specifically at the California case study, California’s agriculture and forestry sector produced 34.65 million tons of CO2 in 2015, accounting for 8% of all of California’s GHG emissions. California’s transportation sector accounted for 39% of GHG emissions, which includes transportation of food from farmland to consumption (www.arb.ca.gov). As demand for food, biofuels, and feedstock continue to increase with the growing global population, without changes in land management and agricultural practices, greenhouse gas emissions will most likely continue to increase.</p>
<p>The main greenhouse gases that are produced from agriculture and food systems are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Globally, the activity within agriculture that accounts for the largest portion of these emissions is enteric fermentation, which produces methane and accounts for nearly 40% of total emissions (Tubiello et al., 2013). Enteric fermentation is the fermentation that occurs during the digestive systems of animals, specifically dairy cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, pigs, mules, horses, etc. The second largest source of GHG emissions is manure being left out on pastures, which produces large quantities of nitrous oxide. Other sources and the associated GHG include rice cultivation (methane), manure management (methane and nitrous oxide), synthetic fertilizers (nitrous oxide), crop residues (nitrous oxide), forest land use (carbon dioxide), cultivated organic soil, and burning crop residues (carbon dioxide) (Tubiello et al., 2013). Within California, agriculture energy use accounted for 4.39 million tons of CO2, agriculture soil management resulted in 5.86 million tons of CO2, enteric fermentation accounted for 11.54 million tons of CO2, and manure management was 11.71 million tons of CO2 (www.arb.ca.gov).</p>
<p>Nitrogen emissions largely result from fertilizer application and manure management. Fertilizer containing nitrogen is applied to crops to increase biomass production. It is estimated that in the 1990s, 16 Tg N2O-N per year was emitted globally, with 40-50% due to human activities such as agricultural activities (Reay et al., 2012). Agricultural nitrous oxide emissions are projected to rise to from the 2010 level of 6.4 Tg N2O-N per year to 7.6 Tg N2O-N per year by 2030. This growth is mainly from non-OECD countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa increasing their agricultural sectors use of nitrogen-fertilizer (Reay et al., 2012). On average, for every 100 units of nitrogen used globally in the agriculture sector, only 17 units are actually consumed by humans through crops, dairy, or meat products (Reay et al., 2012). This excess of nitrogen used in fertilizer and released through manure and crop residues results in large quantities of unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions and provides many possible strategies for future mitigation.</p>
<p>California is a unique case study because its agriculture has high quantities of perennial crops and high value specialty crops; more than half of the fruits, nuts, and vegetables in the United States are produced in California (Kroodsma &amp; Field, 2006). Specialty crops in California account for more than $30 billion in annual agricultural revenue. California’s agricultural land, approximately 3.6x106 ha, accounts for only 3% of the total cultivated land in the United States. Approximately one third of this agricultural land is composed of perennial orchards and vineyards, which accounts for greater than 50% of the total carbon sequestered due to their woody biomass and low-till nature of their soils. Compared to 60% globally, only 20% of California’s cultivated land is used for cereal crops and vegetables crops cover 10% of the land (Kroodsma &amp; Field, 2006). For California, the largest source of agricultural emissions is nitrous oxide through the use of nitrogen fertilizers. Land use change from cropland to urban use produced an increase in GHG emissions, and finally burning of rice crops was a large producer of emissions. However, agricultural practices have moved away from rice crop burning and instead do residue incorporation and winter flooding. This has actually been shown to increase methane emissions so moving forward some suggestions include mid-season drainage and reduced winter flooding (Haden et al., 2012). This example shows the complexity behind switching land use, management practices, and preventing adverse GHG emissions. It is important to consider the farmers’ livelihoods and profits when determining future mitigations that are realistic for each separate part of the agriculture sector.</p>
<p>In terms of land use, increased urban sprawl has become an important issue in terms of fighting to maintain farmers’ livelihoods, sustain food production, and prevent increased GHG emissions. If land use changes so that cropland is left unsown for a period, is converted to non-irrigated rangeland, or restored to natural habitat it decreases anthropogenic emissions. Urban sprawl though results in an increase in anthropogenic emissions and causes increased deforestation and conversion of grasslands to continue food production levels (Haden et al., 2012). Deforestation causes an increase in carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere and decreased ability to store carbon within the soil and plants. In contrast, afforestation helps to decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide (Dale, 1997); when natural ecosystems are converted to agriculture, the soil can lose 20-40% of its carbon over the first few decades of use (Kroodsma &amp; Field, 2006).</p>
<p>The use of land for biofuel sources has conflicting results in terms of impacts on GHG emissions. The global production of wheat, coarse grains, and vegetable oils for biofuel use is projected to rise from 160 million tons in 2010 to more than 200 million tons by 2020 (Ready et al., 2012). While many studies show replacing gasoline with biofuels reduces GHGs and growing biofuel feedstocks removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, many studies fail to account for the emissions associated with land-use change (Searchinger et al., 2008). As farmers respond to the worldwide call for increased biofuel use, they often resort to converting forest and grassland into new cropland to meet this demand. Searchinger et al. estimates that emissions increase by 50% if farmers change cropland originally used for corn to switchgrass (2008). When farmers convert forest or grassland to new cropland, the plowing releases carbon previously stored in the plants and soil to the atmosphere through combustion or fire. The loss of mature forests also reduces carbon sequestration that would have continued through plants growing each year. Additionally, the diversion of existing crops and cropland into biofuel sources causes higher crop prices, which then incentivizes farmers to clear more forest and grassland to replace crops for feed and food. In Brazil, it was shown that higher soybean prices accelerated clearing of the rainforest. With this in mind, while biofuel use reduces dependence on fossil fuels and GHG emissions, biofuels from waste products should be encouraged (Searchinger et al., 2008).</p>
<p>The transportation sector accounts for a large portion of anthropogenic greenhouse gases emitted, a portion of this is food transportation. Food that is sourced by major retailers from global supply chains can travel thousands of miles before it is consumed (Caputo, Nayga Jr., Scarpa, 2013). Food transportation by air and road consumes large quantities of fossil fuels. For example, in the United Kingdom, food transport is responsible for 18,444 kton of CO2 emissions. In general, food distribution and retail accounts for about one third of GHG emissions from the commercial food sector, with food transportation accounting for 18% of total emissions. Food refrigeration during transportation greatly increases energy consumption and emissions from fossil fuels; this increases even more for foods that are frozen with energy requirements reaching 33% more compared to food that is chilled (Tassou, De-Lille, &amp; Ge, 2009).</p>
<p>Current approaches to food transport refrigeration include semi-trailer insulated boxes, refrigeration units, such as vapor compression system, air delivery system that optimizes air flow and temperature distribution, multi-compartment vehicles where each compartment has an individual temperature set point, eutectic systems, and cryogenic cooling systems. With all of these methods, there are limitations to the effectiveness of refrigeration. For example, the semi-trailer insulated rigid boxes are prone to the insulation material deteriorating over time, which results in an increase in thermal conductivity after a few years; after 9 years, a 50% increase in energy consumption and CO2 emissions is needed to retain proper refrigeration standards (Tassou, De-Lille, &amp; Ge, 2009). In general, while some improvements can be made to the materials and construction of the various refrigeration and freezing methods, the temperature integrity of transported food cannot be compromised due to various legislation and food safety standards.</p>
<p>An interesting study in the UK focused on the comparison between a large-scale vegetable box system and the traditional supply system where the customer travels to a local farm stand. The findings suggest that an individual customer driving a round-trip distance of more than 6.7 km to purchase organic produce will most likely produce higher carbon emissions than the emissions from the large-scale vegetable delivery system for organic vegetables; this includes emissions from cold storage, packing, and transport to a regional hub and then transport to the customer’s doorstep (Coley, Howard, and Winter, 2009). A study by Tassou, De-Lille, &amp; Ge showed that the energy consumption to maintain proper refrigeration is 16% higher for multi-drop distribution compared to single-drop distribution (2009); an aspect that may impact the overall value of a large-scale vegetable delivery system. This is an interesting collection of case studies for cities and countries that depend on local farm stands for organic produce. With online sales of food expected to continue to grow at a significant rate in coming years, more focus on the value of buying local versus online delivery systems should be explored in varying economies and city designs. Sustainably transporting and refrigerating food can help to prevent an increase in the carbon emissions that affect climate change intensity and trends.</p>
<p>With the agriculture sector producing a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions globally, there is a large potential for climate change mitigation strategies. The passage of the Global Warming Solutions Act in 2006 in California launched the state into the spotlight as an experiment for climate change policy effectiveness at reducing greenhouse gases. The aim of the act is to reduce GHG emissions to the 1990 levels by 2020, and then a further 80% by 2050 (Haden et al., 2012). This has prompted California to begin to implement new mitigation strategies in all sectors, including agriculture.</p>
<p>In general, there are many mitigation strategies available for agriculture. Carbon sequestration is the process by which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and held in soil or plants. Carbon sequestering in agricultural soils can partially offset fossil fuel emissions with the biggest impact coming from switching from conventional tillage to no-till (West &amp; Marland, 2002). By preventing the disturbance of the soil, no-till practice enhances carbon sequestration and also reduces fossil fuel CO2 emissions from the use of farm equipment. Another option for carbon sequestration is to include cover crops, such as legumes, grasses, buckwheat, and brassicas, in cropping systems (Poeplau &amp; Don, 2015). Converting surplus farm lands back to natural ecosystems also results in increased carbon storage and carbon sequestration; restoring degraded lands could largely offset carbon emissions (Cole et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Within California, it is estimated that annual agriculture is only sequestering 12 g C/M^2 per year in soils, which is far less than the average for US agricultural land that ranges from 13-32. Kroodsma &amp; Field attribute this low sequestration rate to California’s warm temperatures, intensive irrigation practices, and a general lack of conservation tillage (no-till) (2006). With this low starting point, California has large potential for carbon sequestration with estimates reaching almost doubling their current levels though adapting no-till practices and returning all orchard prunings to the soil. This conservation tillage practice may not be rapidly adopted because of California’s high intensity agriculture but as climate change policies aim to reduce greenhouse gases this practice may be more widely adopted. Additionally, California is a large producer of nuts, including almond and walnuts. It is estimated that between the years 1980 and 2000, if all of the prunings from these crops were returned to the soil, then California could have sequestered an additional 1.6 Tg C (Kroodsma &amp; Field, 2006).</p>
<p>Other mitigation strategies include altering management practices, improving fertilizer use, reduction of burning of crops, feed supplementation for cattle to decrease methane emissions from enteric fermentation, avoidance of food loss and waste, curbing urban sprawl, and reducing animal product consumption. Changes in management practices include returning higher amounts of organic material to soil, decreased periods of fallow, increased use of perennial and winter cover crops, recycling of organic wastes, erosion control, and agroforestry (Cole et al., 1997). Fuel consumption has relatively small mitigation potential compared to other methods; however, reductions can result from a decrease in tillage, optimized irrigation scheduling, solar drying of crops, and improved fertilizer management. In terms of fertilizer management, many countries over fertilize crops, such as China and India (Reay et al., 2012). By changing the source of the nitrogen, using fertilizers stabilized with urease or nitrification inhibitors or controlled-release fertilizers, reducing rates of fertilizer, and optimizing placement and timing of fertilizer can help to reduce the excess amounts of anthropogenic nitrous oxide emissions (Reay et al., 2012). As with any mitigation or adaptation strategy, the practices that are acceptable will depend on the region. Strategies that compromise workers’ livelihoods will not be easily accepted and strategies that result in other benefits to the farmers, such a reduction in spending on fertilizer, will be the most successful.</p>
<p>Some of the mitigation strategies listed above also produce health co-benefits. The lack of air pollution from a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is a clear benefit that reduces respiratory, cardiovascular, and cancer adverse outcomes. Additionally, while a reduction in animal product consumption can help to reduce nitrous oxide and methane emissions, multiple studies have shown a decrease in cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type II diabetes (Friel et al., 2009). Animal foods are important sources of protein, energy and nutrients (iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and zinc) but are also sources of saturated fats. Reducing dietary intake of saturated fat has a protective effect from disability from ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio of 0.87) and death from heart disease (hazard ratio of 0.74) for individuals over the age of 35 (Friel et al., 2009).</p>
<p>The agricultural sector plays an important role in influencing climate change trends and patterns. Various agricultural practices, food waste, land use change, and food transportation all produce large quantities of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. There is great potential for mitigation and reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and food systems. These mitigation strategies also have health and environmental co-benefits with the reduction of animal product consumption and deforestation. Future policies aimed at addressing climate change need to focus on policies that target realistic advances in technology and management practices to avoid negatively impacting farmers’ livelihoods and the sector’s ability to address growing food consumption and biofuel needs.</p>
